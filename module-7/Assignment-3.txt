Location-Based Reminder App

Objective: To teach students about location-based services in Android.

Task: In this assignment, students will build an app that allows users to set reminders based on their current location. For example, a user can set a reminder to buy groceries when they are near a supermarket. This assignment will cover location tracking, geofencing, and background services.

Instructions:

Step 1: Project Setup (10 points)

Instruct students to create a new Android app project for the location-based reminder application. They should use Kotlin as the programming language.
Step 2: User Registration and Login (20 points)

Implement user registration and login functionality. Users should be able to create an account and log in.
Step 3: Adding Locations (20 points)

Enable users to add specific locations (e.g., supermarkets, pharmacies) to the app. These locations will serve as reminders' triggers.
Step 4: Setting Reminders (30 points)

Users should be able to set reminders associated with specific locations. When they are near a defined location, the app should trigger the reminder.
Step 5: Location Tracking and Geofencing (40 points)

Implement location tracking to determine the user's current location. Integrate geofencing to monitor when the user enters or exits a predefined geographical area (e.g., a supermarket's vicinity).
Step 6: Background Services (20 points)

Ensure that the app can operate efficiently in the background to monitor location changes and trigger reminders.
Step 7: Reminder Notifications (20 points)

When a user enters a predefined geographical area (geofence), the app should send a reminder notification. Implement this feature.
Step 8: UI/UX Enhancements (20 points)

Encourage students to improve the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of the app. Pay attention to the design and layout of the location setting and reminder creation screens.
Step 9: Testing and Bug Fixes (20 points)

Thoroughly test the app, especially the location tracking, geofencing, and background service features. Address any bugs or issues that arise.
Step 10: Documentation (10 points)

Provide documentation that explains how to use the location-based reminder app, including instructions for setting reminders and managing locations.
Step 11: Submission (10 points)

Students should submit the completed Android project, including updated XML layout files, Kotlin code, and documentation.
Grading Criteria:

Successful implementation of user registration and login functionality.

Functional location management: users can add and edit locations.

Proper creation and management of reminders associated with locations.

Accurate location tracking, geofencing, and background service operation.

Reliable reminder notifications triggered by geofences.

Improved user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) with attention to design and layout.

Thorough testing of location-based features to ensure proper functionality.

Clear and concise documentation explaining how to use the location-based reminder app, including instructions for setting reminders and managing locations.
