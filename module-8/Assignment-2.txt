Open-Source Contribution

Objective: To introduce students to open-source development and contributions.

Task: In this assignment, students should choose an open-source Kotlin project hosted on platforms like GitHub and make a meaningful contribution. This contribution could involve fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving documentation, or addressing an issue. Students should follow the project's contribution guidelines and actively collaborate with the project maintainers.

Instructions:

Step 1: Project Selection (10 points)

Instruct students to explore open-source Kotlin projects on platforms like GitHub and choose one that aligns with their interests and skill level. Encourage them to select projects with active maintainers and clear contribution guidelines.
Step 2: Contribution Plan (15 points)

Students should thoroughly examine the project they've chosen and identify a specific area for improvement. This could be fixing a bug, adding a feature, enhancing documentation, or addressing an open issue.

Ask students to create a detailed contribution plan that outlines the following:

Description of the selected contribution.
Expected impact on the project.
The specific files or code they will modify.
Any external resources or research required.
A proposed timeline for completing the contribution.
Step 3: Fork and Clone (10 points)

Instruct students to fork the chosen open-source project's repository and clone it to their local development environment.
Step 4: Contribution Implementation (40 points)

Students should implement their planned contribution by making code changes, adding documentation, or addressing issues. They should follow the project's coding style and guidelines.
Step 5: Collaboration (10 points)

Encourage students to actively collaborate with the project's maintainers and community members. They should:
Open a discussion or issue on the project repository to communicate their intent and approach.
Seek feedback and guidance from maintainers.
Be responsive to comments and suggestions from the project community.
Step 6: Pull Request (15 points)

Once the contribution is complete and tested, students should create a pull request (PR) to submit their changes to the project. The PR should include a clear description of the contribution, any related issue references, and a summary of the changes made.
