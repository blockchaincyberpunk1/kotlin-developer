Kotlin Language Updates Research

Objective: To keep students updated with the latest Kotlin language features and updates.

Task: In this assignment, students should research and prepare a detailed report on the most recent Kotlin language updates and features introduced in the latest release. They should explain how these updates can be beneficial for Kotlin developers and provide examples of their usage.

Instructions:

Step 1: Topic Selection (10 points)

Instruct students to select the latest Kotlin release (e.g., Kotlin 1.x) as the focus of their research. They should identify the major features and updates introduced in that release.
Step 2: Research and Content Creation (40 points)

Students should conduct thorough research on the selected Kotlin release and its new features. They should consider the following points in their report:
Introduction: Provide an overview of the Kotlin release, including the version number and its release date.
Major Features: Describe the significant features and updates introduced in the release. Explain how these features enhance Kotlin's capabilities and the problems they address.
