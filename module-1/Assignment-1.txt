Hello, Kotlin!

Objective: To introduce students to basic Kotlin syntax and the println function.

Task: Ask students to write a Kotlin program that prints "Hello, Kotlin!" to the console. Ensure they understand how to define the main function and use the println statement for output.

Instructions:

Step 1: Setup (5 points)

Ensure students have Kotlin installed on their development environment.
Step 2: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., HelloKotlin.kt) using their preferred code editor or IDE.
Step 3: Write Kotlin Code (15 points)

Students should write a simple Kotlin program that does the following:
Defines a main function.
Uses the println statement to print "Hello, Kotlin!" to the console.
Step 4: Compile and Run (5 points)

Guide students on how to compile and run their Kotlin program from the command line or within their IDE.
Step 5: Submission (10 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., HelloKotlin.kt) along with a screenshot or terminal output showing the successful execution of their program.
Grading Criteria:

Presence of a correctly defined main function.
Proper use of the println statement to print "Hello, Kotlin!".
Successful compilation and execution of the Kotlin program.
Submission of the Kotlin code file and execution proof.
