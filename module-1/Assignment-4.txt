Looping with Kotlin

Objective: To introduce students to loops in Kotlin.

Task: Ask students to write a program that uses a loop (for or while) to print the numbers from 1 to 10. They should practice both types of loops to understand how they work in Kotlin.

Instructions:

Step 1: Setup (5 points)

Ensure students have Kotlin installed on their development environment.
Step 2: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., Looping.kt) using their preferred code editor or IDE.
Step 3: Write Kotlin Code (30 points)

Students should write a Kotlin program that does the following:
Uses a for loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.
Uses a while loop to achieve the same result.
Demonstrates their understanding of loop syntax, including initialization, condition, and increment (for loops) or update (while loops).
Step 4: Compile and Run (5 points)

Guide students on how to compile and run their Kotlin program from the command line or within their IDE.
Step 5: Test and Compare (10 points)

Encourage students to test their program and compare the results from both for and while loops to ensure correctness.
Step 6: Submission (10 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., Looping.kt) along with a brief explanation of how they implemented and tested both for and while loops.
Grading Criteria:

Correct implementation of both for and while loops.
Properly printed numbers from 1 to 10 using each type of loop.
Successful compilation and execution of the Kotlin program.
Testing to compare the results of both loop types.
Submission of the Kotlin code file and a description of the implementation and testing process.
