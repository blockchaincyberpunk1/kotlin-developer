Simple Calculator

Objective: To reinforce the concept of variables and basic arithmetic operations.

Task: Instruct students to write a Kotlin program that takes two numbers as input (through user input or hard-coded values) and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on these numbers. The program should display the results.

Instructions:

Step 1: Setup (5 points)

Ensure students have Kotlin installed on their development environment.
Step 2: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., SimpleCalculator.kt) using their preferred code editor or IDE.
Step 3: Write Kotlin Code (25 points)

Students should write a Kotlin program that does the following:
Accepts two numbers as input (either through user input or hard-coded values).
Performs the following operations:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Displays the results of these operations in a clear and organized manner.
Step 4: Compile and Run (5 points)

Guide students on how to compile and run their Kotlin program from the command line or within their IDE.
Step 5: Test Different Inputs (10 points)

Encourage students to test their program with different sets of input values to ensure it correctly performs the arithmetic operations.
Step 6: Submission (10 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., SimpleCalculator.kt) along with a brief explanation of how they tested their program and any observations they made during testing.
Grading Criteria:

Correct implementation of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.
Proper display of results.
Successful compilation and execution of the Kotlin program.
Testing with different input values to ensure correctness.
Submission of the Kotlin code file and testing observations.
