Functions in Kotlin

Objective: To teach students how to define and call functions in Kotlin.

Task: Assign students a problem that requires them to write a Kotlin program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using a custom function. They should define a function called calculateFactorial that takes an integer as an argument and returns its factorial.

Instructions:

Step 1: Setup (5 points)

Ensure students have Kotlin installed on their development environment.
Step 2: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., Factorial.kt) using their preferred code editor or IDE.
Step 3: Write Kotlin Code (30 points)

Students should write a Kotlin program that does the following:
Defines a function called calculateFactorial that takes an integer as an argument and returns its factorial.
Handles the case of negative integers by displaying an error message.
Demonstrates their understanding of function definition, parameter passing, and function calls.
Step 4: Compile and Run (5 points)

Guide students on how to compile and run their Kotlin program from the command line or within their IDE.
Step 5: Test (10 points)

Encourage students to test their program with different positive integers to ensure that the calculateFactorial function correctly calculates the factorial.
Step 6: Submission (10 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., Factorial.kt) along with a brief explanation of how they implemented and tested the calculateFactorial function.
Grading Criteria:

Correct implementation of the calculateFactorial function.
Proper handling of negative integers with an error message.
Successful compilation and execution of the Kotlin program.
Testing of the calculateFactorial function with different positive integers.
Submission of the Kotlin code file and a description of the implementation and testing process.
