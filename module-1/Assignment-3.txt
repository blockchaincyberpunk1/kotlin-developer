Conditional Statements

Objective: To teach students about conditional statements (if, else if, else) in Kotlin.

Task: Assign a problem where students need to create a Kotlin program that reads an integer from the user and then displays whether the number is positive, negative, or zero using if-else statements.

Instructions:

Step 1: Setup (5 points)

Ensure students have Kotlin installed on their development environment.
Step 2: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., ConditionalStatements.kt) using their preferred code editor or IDE.
Step 3: Write Kotlin Code (25 points)

Students should write a Kotlin program that does the following:
Prompts the user to enter an integer.
Reads the integer input.
Uses if-else statements to determine whether the entered number is positive, negative, or zero.
Displays an appropriate message based on the condition met.
Step 4: Compile and Run (5 points)

Guide students on how to compile and run their Kotlin program from the command line or within their IDE.
Step 5: Test Different Inputs (10 points)

Encourage students to test their program with various integers to ensure it correctly identifies whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
Step 6: Submission (10 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., ConditionalStatements.kt) along with a brief explanation of how they tested their program and any observations they made during testing.
Grading Criteria:

Correct implementation of if-else statements to determine the sign of the entered number.
Proper display of the result message.
Successful compilation and execution of the Kotlin program.
Testing with different input values to ensure correctness.
Submission of the Kotlin code file and testing observations.
