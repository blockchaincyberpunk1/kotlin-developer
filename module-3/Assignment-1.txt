Creating Classes and Objects in Kotlin

Objective: To practice creating classes and objects in Kotlin.

Task: Students should create a Kotlin program that simulates a simple library system. They should define the following classes:

Book: Represents a book with properties like title, author, and ISBN.

Library: Represents a library with properties like name and location. It should have methods to:

Add books to its collection.
Remove books from its collection.
Display available books.
Person: Represents a person with properties like name, age, and address.

Instructions:

Step 1: Setup (5 points)

Ensure students have Kotlin installed on their development environment.
Step 2: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., LibrarySystem.kt) using their preferred code editor or IDE.
Step 3: Define Classes (40 points)

Students should define the three classes (Book, Library, and Person) with their respective properties and methods.
The Library class should have methods to add books, remove books, and display available books.
Ensure that proper data types (e.g., strings, integers) are used for class properties.
Step 4: Create Objects (10 points)

Guide students on how to create objects of these classes in the main function.
They should simulate library operations, such as adding books to the library, removing books, and displaying available books.
Step 5: Compile and Run (5 points)

Explain how to compile and run their Kotlin program from the command line or within their IDE.
Step 6: Testing (10 points)

Encourage students to test their program by adding, removing, and displaying books.
Verify that the program behaves as expected and handles different scenarios.
Step 7: Documentation (10 points)

Ask students to include comments in their code to explain the purpose of each class and method, as well as how to use them.
Step 8: Submission (15 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., LibrarySystem.kt) along with a brief description of how they implemented and tested the program.
Grading Criteria:

Correct definition of the Book, Library, and Person classes.
Accurate implementation of methods in the Library class (add books, remove books, display available books).
Proper instantiation and usage of objects in the main function.
Thorough testing of the program, covering various library operations.
Inclusion of comments to explain code segments.
