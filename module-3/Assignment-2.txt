Inheritance and Polymorphism in Kotlin

Objective: To reinforce understanding of inheritance and polymorphism in Kotlin.

Task: Building on Assignment 1 (Library System), assign students a problem that extends the library system. In this assignment, students should:

Step 1: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., LibrarySystemV2.kt) to build upon the previous assignment.
Step 2: Implement Inheritance (15 points)

Students should create a new class called EBook that inherits from the Book class.
The EBook class should include additional properties specific to e-books, such as fileSize and format.
Ensure that the EBook class correctly extends the Book class and includes its own properties.
Step 3: Enhance the Library Class (20 points)

In the Library class, add support for storing both physical books (from Assignment 1) and e-books (newly introduced).
Implement a method in the Library class called displayAllBooks that displays details of all books in the library's collection, regardless of their type (physical book or e-book).
Use polymorphism to iterate through the collection and display book details in a way that handles both physical books and e-books seamlessly.
Step 4: Testing (10 points)

Encourage students to test their program thoroughly.
Add both physical books and e-books to the library's collection.
Call the displayAllBooks method to ensure that it correctly displays details for all types of books.
Step 5: Documentation (10 points)

Ask students to include comments in their code to explain the purpose of the EBook class, the enhancements made to the Library class, and how to use the displayAllBooks method.
Step 6: Submission (20 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., LibrarySystemV2.kt) along with a brief description of how they implemented and tested the program.
Grading Criteria:

Proper inheritance with the creation of the EBook class.
Correct implementation of the EBook class with the specified additional properties.
Successful enhancement of the Library class to support both physical books and e-books.
Accurate implementation of the displayAllBooks method, demonstrating polymorphism.
Thorough testing of the program, including adding and displaying both physical books and e-books.
Inclusion of comments to explain code segments.
