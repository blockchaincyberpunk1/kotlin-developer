Conditional Statements in Kotlin

Objective: To reinforce understanding of conditional statements in Kotlin.

Task: Students should create a Kotlin program that:

Prompts the user for their age.
Uses an if-else statement to determine if the user is a minor (under 18), an adult (18 or older but under 65), or a senior (65 or older).
Displays an appropriate message based on the user's age group.
Instructions:

Step 1: Setup (5 points)

Ensure students have Kotlin installed on their development environment.
Step 2: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., AgeClassifier.kt) using their preferred code editor or IDE.
Step 3: Write Kotlin Code (30 points)

Students should write a Kotlin program that covers the following concepts:
Prompt the user to enter their age (hint: use the readLine() function to read user input as a string).
Convert the user's input to an integer.
Use an if-else statement to classify the user into one of the following age groups: minor, adult, or senior.
Display an appropriate message based on the user's age group.
Step 4: Compile and Run (5 points)

Guide students on how to compile and run their Kotlin program from the command line or within their IDE.
Step 5: Testing (10 points)

Encourage students to test their program with different age values to ensure that the correct messages are displayed for each age group.
Step 6: Documentation (10 points)

Ask students to include comments in their code to explain how the program works and how the if-else statement is used for age classification.
Step 7: Submission (10 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., AgeClassifier.kt) along with a brief description of how they implemented and tested the program.
Grading Criteria:

Correct implementation of user input and age classification.
Accurate display of messages for different age groups.
Successful compilation and execution of the Kotlin program.
Testing of the program with various age values.
Inclusion of comments to explain code segments.
