Working with Collections in Kotlin

Objective: To introduce students to Kotlin's collection operations.

Task: Students should write a Kotlin program that:

Creates a list of integers.
Uses the filter function to filter out even numbers from the list.
Uses the map function to square each number in the filtered list.
Uses the reduce function to find the sum of the squared values.
Instructions:

Step 1: Setup (5 points)

Ensure students have Kotlin installed on their development environment.
Step 2: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., CollectionsExample.kt) using their preferred code editor or IDE.
Step 3: Write Kotlin Code (40 points)

Students should write a Kotlin program that accomplishes the following:
Create a list of integers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]).
Use the filter function to filter out even numbers from the list.
Use the map function to square each number in the filtered list.
Use the reduce function to find the sum of the squared values.
Step 4: Compile and Run (5 points)

Guide students on how to compile and run their Kotlin program from the command line or within their IDE.
Step 5: Testing (10 points)

Encourage students to test their program with different input lists to ensure correctness.
Step 6: Documentation (10 points)

Ask students to include comments in their code to explain the purpose of each operation and how they work.
Step 7: Submission (10 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., CollectionsExample.kt) along with a brief description of how they implemented and tested the program.
Grading Criteria:

Correct creation of the list of integers.
Accurate usage of the filter function to filter even numbers.
Proper application of the map function to square the numbers.
Successful use of the reduce function to find the sum of squared values.
Testing of the program with different input lists.
Inclusion of comments to explain code segments.
