Kotlin Syntax Overview

Objective: To introduce students to basic Kotlin syntax and language features.

Task: In this assignment, students should write a Kotlin program that covers the following concepts:

Variable declaration and initialization
Basic data types (int, double, string, boolean)
String interpolation
Basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /)
Printing results using println()
Instructions:

Step 1: Setup (5 points)

Ensure students have Kotlin installed on their development environment.
Step 2: Create a Kotlin File (5 points)

Instruct students to create a new Kotlin file (e.g., SyntaxOverview.kt) using their preferred code editor or IDE.
Step 3: Write Kotlin Code (30 points)

Students should write a Kotlin program that demonstrates the following concepts:
Declare and initialize variables of different data types (int, double, string, boolean).
Use string interpolation to display the values of these variables.
Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and store the results in variables.
Print the results and intermediate values using the println() function.
Step 4: Compile and Run (5 points)

Guide students on how to compile and run their Kotlin program from the command line or within their IDE.
Step 5: Test and Documentation (10 points)

Encourage students to test their program with various data values to ensure correct calculations.
Ask students to include comments in their code to explain the purpose of variables and operations.
Step 6: Submission (10 points)

Students should submit their Kotlin code file (e.g., SyntaxOverview.kt) along with a brief description of how they implemented and tested the program.
Grading Criteria:

Correct use of variable declaration and initialization.
Proper demonstration of basic data types and arithmetic operations.
Successful compilation and execution of the Kotlin program.
Testing of the program with various data values.
Inclusion of comments to explain code segments.
